Lab 4 Advanced Programming

Introduction:
	In this lab we have to implement the file crawler and perform the search in directories and sub-directories and return the user paths of the folders which were searched by user. Also read the files to check if the keyword searched is found in any of the file so we also have to return the path of that file. I have implemented it by first crawling the directories and storing the results in text document and store them also in map as key value pairs. So that we can find the value which is path of the file easily for the key as search keyword provided by user. Then we also splitted the extensions from the file names so it becomes easier to open and read the text file whose content has to be read and report to user.

Working:
		Executing the FileCrawler.java file which contains the class and main. It will execute and first it will collect all the files in directories and their path names. And then user will be asked to give the keyword to search then it will search the map for the respective keyword.
